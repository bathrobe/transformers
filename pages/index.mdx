# Teach Yourself Transformers

This website is an annotated bibliography containing all of the free online resources I used to teach myself machine learning from July 2021-May 2023.

It starts with the absolute basics of machine learning (finding line of best fit to a scatterplot) and ends with coding a functional GPT-style text generation model in a Jupyter notebook (and being able to understand everything that's going on.)

I took notes on lectures in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), which were then converted into spaced repetition flashcards using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) so core concepts could be drilled. (There's a [plugin](https://github.com/reuseman/flashcards-obsidian) for it.) I highly recommend this approach if you're serious about retaining the material.

I cannot claim to be an expert in this field. However, if you're hoping to reach the level of "seasoned amateur," I think you could do worse than this sequence of videos.

Only prerequisite is Python. If you want to learn that, this [Replit course](https://replit.com/learn/100-days-of-python) seemed pretty cool. FreeCodeCamp has a [Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) section, too.
