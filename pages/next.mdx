# Next steps

I'm still working my way through that Karpathy video, but that's not stopping me from adding some additional courses I want to get to.

## Prompt engineering

There's a [GitHub](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide) course that was looking good. I want to be able to apply Chain-of-thought prompting to my problems if possible.

## Vector database stuff

I've developed cosine similarity searches for other projects and it works great. I'd like to dive deeper into [embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) and their applications in prompt injections.

## Practical deep learning for coders pt 2

I hear [fast.ai](https://course19.fast.ai/part2) has a second section out now, in which they dive deep into Stable Diffusion.

## Farewell

I hope you enjoyed this annotated bibliography. You can see more of my work at https://joeholmes.dev. If it helped you or you want to chat about ML, email me at hello@joeholmes.dev.
