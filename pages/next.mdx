# Next steps

I'm still working my way through that Karpathy video, but that's not stopping me from adding some additional courses I want to get to.

## The Full Stack's LLM Bootcamp

I came across this course prototyping [Flashbang](https://flashbang.school), a learning app I'm building. After watching a few lectures I can confidently say it's top notch. This course occupied a rare niche in today's booming ML education landscape: world class technical experts walking a general audience through intuitions about end user / more general developer work around these tools.
